# Meeting Notes

##  EDW Data Integration and Development
### Agenda

-   what is a good development process? leasons learned from this HR project (e.g., making it clear to business - including odysseus- that we need to spec it all out first and not keep going back and forth)

-   what has been written in script? what do sources need to clean up (e.g. should I update the MS Forms submission to match the clean up list?, etc.)

-   how do we manage projects where there is no data steward?
